<p>Hi I'm Nate Powers and I have been going to school for web development since October 2020. I currently have my HTML certifcate from w3 schools and am working on the CSS and JavaScript certificates. I am lived in Arizona for 26 years and like their sport teams. Over the summer in 2021 I drew the starting line up for the Suns and recently started drawing the Cardinals team. I enjoy drawing and web devolopment and figured I would make a website.</p>
